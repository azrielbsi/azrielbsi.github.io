I can't throw away the pieces that you gave<br>
betrayed in a way <br>
Of a knife stuck on my back <br>

How could you do this, we've been through this for a while <br>
Once a cure <br>
now's a scar <br>

Hold me not<br>
Give me back my mind <br>
my thoughts that you've taken <br>
starve me to care<br>

Could the night help me shut you out ?<br>
You gave me a lesson <br>
Not to go and dive <br>
But i already dive<br>

I will try to latch myself out of your space <br>
Far away <br>
Untill the distance passed its line<br>

Its a new journey, my heart has had enough of pain <br>
Once a fool <br>
Now iam awake <br>

Hold me not<br>
Give me back my mind <br>
my thoughts that you've taken <br>
starve me to care<br>

Could the night help me shut you out ?<br>
You gave me a lesson <br>
Not to go and dive <br>

Not to go and dive <br>
Not to go and dive <br>
Not to go and dive <br>
Not to go and dive <br>
But i already dive <br>
But i already dive <br>

You between the dawn and blackest sky <br>

Could the night help me shut you out ?<br>
A lesson <br>
Not to go and dive <br>
But i already dive<br>
But i already dive<br>
